Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: a hidden ".git" folder gets created, which contains the metadata that GIT needs to do its job


Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: the staging area is like a holding zone; the working directory holds the changes you've been making; the repository stores *committed* changes. So, files in the staging area are changes you've made that you are *ready* to commit to the repository. I guess this lets you group related changes to commit in one transaction
